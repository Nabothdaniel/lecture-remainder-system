# AI Project Generator - EduProGen


This project is a **web application that generates complete academic projects (Chapter One to Chapter Five)** automatically. Users provide **project topics, discipline/department, and context**, and the system dynamically creates structured research content (Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Data Analysis, and Conclusion).

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user submits a project topic, discipline, and extra context (e.g., case study, university guidelines, methodology preference).
2. **Content Generation**: The system uses AI + curated templates to generate Chapters 1–5 tailored to the input.
3. **Customization**: Users can refine, edit, or regenerate specific chapters.
4. **Export**: The final project can be exported as **DOCX, PDF, or TXT**.

## Technologies Used

* **Vite** – Fast development environment
* **TypeScript + React** – Frontend framework
* **TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui** – Styling & UI components
* **PHP (** – For backend processing 
* **AI Model Integration** – Slim fine-tuned models for academic project generation
